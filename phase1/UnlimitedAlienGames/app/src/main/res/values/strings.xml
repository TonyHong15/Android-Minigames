    <string name="alien_shooter_instructions">In this game, you will be shooting evil aliens that
    happen to see. \n\nA normal alien is a blue alien that you should not shoot. \n\nAn evil alien
        is a red and yellow devil alien. \n\nThe purpose of this game is to click as many
    evil aliens that you see as possible.\n\nEach successful hit on a evil alien gets you
        one point while an
    accidental hit to a normal alien loses you 2 points.\n\nYou will have 30 seconds to shoot as
        many
    evil aliens as you can and score as high as possible.\n\n Good Luck!! </string>
